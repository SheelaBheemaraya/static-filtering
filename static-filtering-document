# static-filtering

Jackson has two annotations that are used in filtering are: @JsonIgnore and @JsonIgnoreProperties.
1.@JsonIgnore  is a member or method level annotation. It expects that the properties to be excluded are marked one by one.
2.@JsonIgnoreProperties is a class-level annotation. It ignores the logical properties in JSON serialization and deserialization.
